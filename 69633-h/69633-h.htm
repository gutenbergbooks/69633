<p>Within gun-reach in front of me trudged my
little Akawai Indian hunter. He turned his head
suddenly, his ears catching some sound which
mine had missed, and I saw that his profile was
rather like that of Dante. Instantly the thought
spread and the simile deepened. Were we two
not all alone? and this unearthly hour and light—Then
I chuckled softly, but the silence that the
chuckle shattered shrank away and made it a
loud, coarse sound, so that I involuntarily drew
in my breath. But it was really amusing, the
thought of Dante setting out on a hunt for kinkajous
and giant armadillos. Jeremiah looked at
me wonderingly, and we went on in silence. And
for the next mile Dante vanished from my
thoughts and I mused upon the sturdy little red
man. Jeremiah was his civilized name; he would
never tell me his real one. It seemed so unsuited
to him that I thought up one still less appropriate
and called him Nupee—which is the three-toed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
sloth; and in his quiet way he saw the humor
of it, for a more agile human being never lived.</p>

<p>Nupee’s face was unclouded, but his position
as hunter to our expedition had brought decisions
and responsibilities which he had not known before.
The simple life,—the unruffled existence
in the little open <i>benab</i>, with hammock, cassava
field, and an occasional hunt,—this was of the
past. A wife had come, slipping quietly into his
life, Indian-fashion; and now, before the baby arrived,
decisions had to be made. Nupee longed
for some store shoes and a suit of black clothes.
He had owned a big <i>benab</i> which he himself had
built; but a godmother, like the cowbird in a
warbler’s nest, had gradually but firmly ousted
him and had filled it with diseased relatives, so
that it was unpleasant to visit. He now, to my
knowledge, owned a single shirt and a pair of
short trousers.</p>

<p>The shoes were achieved. I detected in him
qualities which I knew that I should find in some
one, as I do on every expedition, and I made him
perform some unnecessary labor and gave him
the shoes. But the clothes would cost five dollars,
a month’s wages, and he had promised to
get married—white-fashion—in another month,
and that would consume several times five dollars.
I did not offer to help him decide. His
Akawai marriage ceremony seemed not without
honor, and as for its sincerity—I had seen the
two together. But my lips were sealed. I could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
not tell him that a recementing of the ritual of his
own tribe did not seem quite the equal of a five-dollar
suit of clothes. That was a matter for individual
decision.</p>

<p>But to-night I think that we both had put all
our worries and sorrows far away, and I memory
as well; and I felt sympathy in the quiet, pliant
gait which carried him so swiftly over the sandy
trail. I knew Nupee now for what he was—the
one for whom I am always on the lookout, the exceptional
one, the super-servant, worthy of friendship
as an equal. I had seen his uncle and his
cousins. They were Indians, nothing more. Nupee
had slipped into the place left vacant for a
time by Aladdin, and by Satán and Shimosaka,
by Drojak and Trujillo—all exceptional, all
faithful, all servants first and then friends. I say
‘for a time’—for they all hoped, and I think still
hope with me, that we shall meet and travel and
camp together again, whether in the Cinghalese
thorn-bush, or Himalayan dâks, in Dyak canoes
or among the camphor groves of Sakarajama.</p>

<p>Nupee and I had not been thrown together
closely. This had proved a static expedition,
settled in one place, with no dangers to speak of,
no real roughing it, and we met only after each
hunting trip. But the magic of a full moon had
lured me from my laboratory table, and here we
were, we two, plodding junglewards, becoming
better acquainted in silence than I have often
achieved with much talk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span></p>

<p>It was nearly midnight. We traversed a broad
trail of white sand, between lines of saplings of
pale-barked rubber trees, flooded, saturated, with
milky-gray light. Not a star appeared in the
cloudless sky, which, in contrast to the great
silver moon-plaque, was blue-black. These open
sandy stretches, so recently etched into what had
been primitive jungle, were too glowing with light
for most of the nocturnal creatures who, in darkness,
flew and ran and hunted about in them.
And the lovers of twilight were already come and
gone. The stage was vacant save for one actor—the
nighthawk of the silvery collar, whose eerie
<i>wheeeo!</i> or more leisurely and articulate <i>who-are-you?</i>
was queried from stump and log. There
was in it the same liquid tang, the virile ringing of
skates on ice, which enriches the cry of the whip-poor-will
in our country lanes.</p>

<p>Where the open trail skirted a hillside we came
suddenly upon a great gathering of these goatsuckers,
engaged in some strange midnight revel.
Usually they roost and hunt and call in solitude,
but here at least forty were collected on the white
sand within an area of a few yards. We stopped
and watched. They were dancing—or, rather,
popping, as corn pops in a hopper. One after another,
or a half dozen at a time, they bounced up
a foot or two from the ground and flopped back,
at the instant of leaving and returning uttering a
sudden, explosive <i>wop!</i> This they kept up unceasingly
for the five minutes we gave to them,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
and our passage interrupted them for only a moment.
Later we passed single birds which popped
and wopped in solitary state; whether practicing,
or snobbishly refusing to perform in public,
only they could tell. It was a scene not soon
forgotten.</p>

<p>Suddenly before us rose the jungle, raw-edged,
with border zone of bleached, ashamed trunks
and lofty branches white as chalk, of dead and
dying trees. For no jungle tree, however hardy,
can withstand the blasting of violent sun after
the veiling of emerald foliage is torn away. As
the diver plunges beneath the waves, so, after one
glance backward over the silvered landscape, I
passed at a single stride into what seemed by contrast
inky blackness, relieved by the trail ahead,
which showed as does a ray of light through closed
eyelids. As the chirruping rails climbed among
the roots of the tall cat-tails out yonder, so we
now crept far beneath the level of the moonlit
foliage. The silvery landscape had been shifted
one hundred, two hundred feet above the earth.
We had become lords of creation in name alone,
threading our way humbly among the fungi and
toad-stools, able only to look aloft and wonder
what it was like. And for a long time no voice
answered to tell us whether any creature lived
and moved in the tree-tops.</p>

<p>The tropical jungle by day is the most wonderful
place in the world. At night I am sure it is
the most weirdly beautiful of all places outside<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
the world. For it is primarily unearthly, unreal;
and at last I came to know why. In the light
of the full moon it was rejuvenated. The simile
of theatrical scenery was always present to the
mind, the illusion lying especially in the completeness
of transformation from the jungle by daylight.
The theatrical effect was heightened by
the sense of being in some vast building. This
was due to the complete absence of any breath
of air. Not a leaf moved; even the pendulous
air-roots reaching down their seventy-foot plummets
for the touch of soil did not sway a hair’s
breadth. The throb of the pulse set the rhythm
for one’s steps. The silence, for a time, was as
perfect as the breathlessness. It was a wonderfully
ventilated amphitheatre; the air was as free
from any feeling of tropical heat, as it lacked all
crispness of the north. It was exactly the temperature
of one’s skin. Heat and cold were for
the moment as unthinkable as wind.</p>

<p>One’s body seemed wholly negligible. In soft
padding moccasins and easy swinging gait, close
behind my Indian hunter, and in such khaki
browns that my body was almost invisible to my
own downward glance, I was conscious only of
the play of my senses: of two at first, sight and
smell; later, of hearing. The others did not exist.
We two were unattached, impersonal, moving
without effort or exertion. It was magic, and I
was glad that I had only my Akawai for companion,
for it was magic that a word would have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
shattered. Yet there was this wonderfully satisfying
thing about it, that most magic lacks: it
exists at present, to-day, perhaps, at least once a
month, and I know that I shall experience it
again. When I go to the window and look out
upon the city night, I find all extraneous light
emaciated and shattered by the blare of gas and
electricity, but from one upreaching tower I can
see reflected a sheen which is not generated in any
power-house of earth. Then I know that within
the twenty-four hours the <i>terai</i> jungles of Garhwal,
the tree-ferns of Pahang, and the mighty
<i>moras</i> which now surround us, were standing in
silvery silence and in the peace which only the
wilderness knows.</p>

<p>I soon took the lead and slackened the pace to
a slow walk. Every few minutes we stood motionless,
listening with mouth as well as ears.
For no one who has not listened in such silence
can realize how important the mouth is. Like
the gill of old which gave it origin, our ear has
still an entrance inward as well as outward, and
the sweep of breath and throb of the blood are
louder than we ever suspect. When at an opera
or concert I see some one sitting rapt, listening
with open mouth, I do not think of it as ill-bred.
I know it for unconscious and sincere absorption
based on an excellent physical reason.</p>

<p>It was early spring in the tropics; insect life
was still in the gourmand stage, or that of pupal
sleep. The final period of pipe and fiddle had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
not yet arrived, so that there was no hum from
the underworld. The flow of sap and the spread
of petals were no less silent than the myriad
creatures which, I knew, slumbered or hunted on
every side. It was as if I had slipped back one
dimension in space and walked in a shadow
world. But these shadows were not all colorless.
Although the light was strained almost barren
by the moon mountains, yet the glow from the
distant lava and craters still kept something of
color, and the green of the leaves, great and small,
showed as a rich dark olive. The afternoon’s
rain had left each one filmed with clear water,
and this struck back the light as polished silver.
There was no tempered illumination. The trail
ahead was either black, or a solid sheet of light.
Here and there in the jungle on each side, where
a tree had fallen, or a flue of clear space led moonwards,
the effect was of cold electric light seen
through trees in city parks. When such a shaft
struck down upon us, it surpassed simile. I have
seen old paintings in Belgian cathedrals of celestial
light which now seems less imaginary.</p>

<p>At last the silence was broken, and like the first
breath of the trade-wind which clouds the Mazaruni
surface, the mirror of silence was never quite
clear again—or so it seemed. My northern
mind, stored with sounds of memory, never
instinctively accepted a new voice of the jungle
for what it was. Each had to go through a reference
clearing-house of sorts. It was like the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
psychological reaction to words or phrases. Any
strange wail or scream striking suddenly upon
my ear instantly crystallized some vision of the
past—some circumstance or adventure fraught
with similar sound. Then, appreciably as a second
thought, came the keen concentration of
every sense to identify this new sound, to hear it
again, to fix it in mind with its character and its
meaning. Perhaps at some distant place and time,
in utterly incongruous surroundings, it may in
turn flash into consciousness—a memory-simile
stimulated by some sound of the future.</p>




<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">
<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="II">II</h2>
</div>

<p>I stood in a patch of moonlight listening to the
baying of a hound—or so I thought: that musical
ululation which links man’s companion wolfwards.
Then I thought of the packs of wild hunting
dogs, the dreaded ‘warracabra tigers,’ and I
turned to the Indian at my elbow, full of hopeful
expectation. With his quiet smile he whispered,
‘Kunama,’ and I knew I had heard the giant
tree-frog of Guiana—a frog of size and voice well
in keeping with these mighty jungles. I knew
these were powerful <i>beenas</i> with the Indians,
tokens of good hunting, and every fortunate
benab would have its dried mummy frog hung up
with the tail of the giant armadillo and other
charms. Well might these batrachians arouse
profound emotions among the Indians, familiar
as they are with the strange beings of the forest.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
I could imagine the great goggle-eyed fellow
sprawled high near the roof of the jungle, clutching
the leaves with his vacuum-cupped toes. The
moonlight would make him ghostly—a pastel
frog; but in the day he flaunted splashes of azure
and green on his scarlet body.</p>

<p>At a turn in the trail we squatted and waited
for what the jungle might send of sight or sound.
And in whispers Nupee told me of the big frog
<i>kunama</i>, and its ways. It never came to the
ground, or even descended part way down the
trees; and by some unknown method of distillation
it made little pools of its own in deep hollows,
and there lived. And this water was thick
like honey and white like milk, and when stirred
became reddish. Besides which, it was very bitter.
If a man drank of it, forever after he hopped
each night and clasped all the trees which he encountered,
endlessly endeavoring to ascend them
and always failing. And yet, if he could once
manage to reach a pool of <i>kunama</i> water in an uncut
tree and drink, his manhood would return
and his mind be healed.</p>

<p>When the Indians desired this <i>beena</i>, they
marked a tree whence a frog called at night, and in
the daytime cut it down. Forming a big circle,
they searched and found the frog, and forthwith
smoked it and rubbed it on arrows and bow before
they went out. I listened gravely and found
that it all fitted in with the magic of the night.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
If an Indian had appeared down the trail, hopping
endlessly and gripping the trunks, gazing
upward with staring eyes, I should not have
thought it more strange than the next thing that
really happened.</p>

<p>We had settled on our toes in another squatting-place—a
dark aisle with only scattered
flecks of light. The silence and breathlessness of
the moon-craters could have been no more complete
than that which enveloped us. My eye
wandered from spot to spot, when suddenly I began
to think of that great owl-like goatsucker,
the ‘poor-me-one.’ We had shot one at Kalacoon
a month before and no others had called
since, and I had not thought of the species again.
Quite without reason I began to think of the bird,
of its wonderful markings, of the eyes which
years ago in Trinidad I had made to glow like iridescent
globes in the light of a flash—and then
a poor-me-one called behind us, not fifty feet away.
Even this did not seem strange among
these surroundings. It was an interesting happening,
one which I have experienced many times
in my life. It may have been just another coincidence.
I am quite certain it was not. In any
event it was a Dantesque touch, emphasized by
the character of the call—the wail of a lost soul
being as good a simile as any other. It started as
a high, trembling wail, the final cry being lost in
the depths of whispered woe:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>


<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent105">oh!</div>
    <div class="verse indent12">oh!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Nupee never moved; only his lips formed the name
by which he knew it—<i>kalawoe</i>. Whatever else
characterized the sounds of the jungle at night,
none became monotonous or common. Five
minutes later the great bird called to us from far,
far away, as if from another round of purgatory—an
eerie lure to enter still deeper into the jungle
depths. We never heard it again.</p>

<p>Nature seems to have apportioned the voices
of many of her creatures with sensitive regard for
their environment. Sombre voices seem fittingly
to be associated with subdued light, and joyous
notes with the blaze of sunlit twigs and open
meadows. A bobolink’s bubbling carol is unthinkable
in a jungle, and the strain of a wood
pewee on a sunny hillside would be like an organ
playing dance-music. This is even more pronounced
in the tropics, where, quite aside from
any mental association on my part, the voices
and calls of the jungle reflect the qualities of that
twilight world. The poor-me-one proves too
much. He is the very essence of night, his wings
edged with velvet silence, his plumage the mingled
concentration of moss and lichens and dead
wood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<p>I was about to rise and lead Nupee still farther
into the gloom when the jungle showed another
mood—a silent whimsy, the humor of which I
could not share with the little red man. Close
to my face, so near that it startled me for a moment,
over the curved length of a long, narrow
caladium leaf, there came suddenly two brilliant
lights. Steadily they moved onward, coming up
into view for all the world like two tiny headlights
of a motor-car. They passed, and the broadside
view of this great elater was still absurdly like the
profile of a miniature tonneau with the top down.
I laughingly thought to myself how perfect the illusion
would be if a red tail-light should be shown,
when to my amazement a rosy red light flashed
out behind, and my bewildered eyes all but distinguished
a number! Naught but a tropical
forest could present such contrasts in such rapid
succession as the poor-me-one and this parody of
man’s invention.</p>

<p>I captured the big beetle and slid him into
a vial, where in his disgust he clicked sharply
against the glass. The vial went into my pocket
and we picked up our guns and crept on. As we
traversed a dark patch, dull gleams like heat
lightning flashed over the leaves, and, looking
down, I saw that my khaki was aglow from the
illuminated insect within. This betrayed every
motion, so I wrapped the vial in several sheets of
paper and rolled it up in my handkerchief. The
glow was duller but almost as penetrating. At one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
time or another I have had to make use of all my
garments, from topee to moccasins, in order to confine
captives armed with stings, beaks, teeth, or
fangs, but now I was at a complete loss. I tried a
gun-barrel with a handkerchief stopper, and found
that I now carried an excellent, long-handled flashlight.
Besides, I might have sudden use for the
normal function of the gun. I had nothing sufficiently
opaque to quench those flaring headlights,
and I had to own myself beaten and release him.
He spread his wings and flew swiftly away, his
red light glowing derisively; and even in the flood
of pure moonlight he moved within an aura
which carried far through the jungle. I knew
that killing him was of no use, for a week after
death from chloroform I have seen the entire interior
of a large insect box brilliantly lighted by
the glow of these wonderful candles, still burning
on the dead shoulders of the same kind of insect.</p>

<p>Twice, deeper in the jungle, we squatted and
listened, and twice the silence remained unbroken
and the air unmoved. Happening to look up
through a lofty, narrow canyon of dark foliage, I
was startled as by some sudden sound by seeing
a pure white cloud, moonlit, low down, pass rapidly
across. It was first astounding, then unreal:
a bit of exceedingly poor work on the part of the
property man, who had mixed the hurricane scenery
with that of the dog-days. Even the elements
seemed to have been laved with magic. The zone
of high wind, with its swift-flying clouds, must<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
have been flowing like a river just above the motionless
foliage of the tree-tops.</p>

<p>This piece of ultra-unnaturalism seemed to
break part of the spell and the magic silence was
lifted. Two frogs boomed again, close at hand,
and now all the hound similitude was gone, and
in its place another, still more strange, when we
think of the goggle-eyed author far up in the trees.
The sound now was identical with the short
cough or growl of a hungry lion, and though I
have heard the frogs many times since that night,
this resemblance never changed or weakened. It
seemed as if the volume, the roaring outburst,
could come only from the throat of some large,
full-lunged mammal.</p>

<p>A sudden tearing rush from the trail-side, and
ripping of vines and shrubs, was mingled with
deep, hoarse snorts, and we knew that we had
disturbed one of the big red deer—big only in
comparison with the common tiny brown brockets.
A few yards farther the leaves rustled high
overhead, although no breath of wind had as yet
touched the jungle. I began a slow, careful
search with my flashlight, and, mingled with the
splotches and specks of moonlight high overhead,
I seemed to see scores of little eyes peering down.
But at last my faint electric beam found its mark
and evolved the first bit of real color which the
jungle had shown—always excepting the ruby
tail-light. Two tiny red globes gleamed down at
us, and as they gleamed, moved without a sound,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
apparently unattached, slowly through the foliage.
Then came a voice, as wandering, as impersonal
as the eyes—a sharp, incisive <i>wheeeeeat!</i>
with a cat-like timbre; and from the eyes and
voice I reconstructed a night monkey—a kinkajou.</p>

<p>Then another notch was slipped and the jungle
for a time showed something of the exuberance
of its life. A paca leaped from its meal of nuts
and bounced away with quick, repeated pats; a
beetle with wings tuned to the bass clef droned
by; some giant tree-cricket tore the remaining
intervals of silence to shreds with unmuted wing-fiddles,
<i>cricks</i> so shrill and high that they well-nigh
passed beyond the upper register of my ear
out into silence again. The roar of another frog
was comforting to my ear-drum.</p>

<p>Then silence descended again, and hours passed
in our search for sound or smell of the animal we
wished chiefest to find—the giant armadillo.
These rare beings have a distinct odor. Months
of work in the open had sharpened my nostrils so
that on such a tramp as this they were not much
inferior to those of Nupee. This sense gave me
as keen pleasure as eye or ear, and furnished quite
as much information. The odors of city and civilization
seemed very far away: gasolene, paint,
smoke, perfumery, leather—all these could hardly
be recalled. And how absurd seemed society’s
unwritten taboo on discussion of this admirable
but pitifully degenerate sense! Why may you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
look at your friend’s books, touch his collection
of <i>netsukés</i>, listen to his music, yet dare sniff at
naught but his blossoms!</p>

<p>In the open spaces of the earth, and more than
anywhere in this conservatory of unblown odors,
we come more and more to appreciate and envy
a dog’s sensitive muzzle. Here we sniffed as naturally
as we turned ear, and were able to recognize
many of our nasal impressions, and even to
follow a particularly strong scent to its source.
Few yards of trail but had their distinguishable
scent, whether violent, acrid smell or delectable
fragrance. Long after a crab-jackal had passed,
we noted the stinging, bitter taint in the air; and
now and then the pungent wake of some big jungle-bug
struck us like a tangible barrier.</p>

<p>The most tantalizing odors were the wonderfully
delicate and penetrating ones from some
great burst of blossoms, odors heavy with sweetness,
which seeped down from vine or tree high
overhead, wholly invisible from below even in
broad daylight. These odors remained longest
in memory, perhaps because they were so completely
the product of a single sense. There were
others too, which were unforgettable, because,
like the voice of the frog, they stirred the memory
a fraction before they excited curiosity. Such
I found the powerful musk from the bed of leaves
which a fawn had just left. For some reason this
brought vividly to mind the fearful compound
of smells arising from the decks of Chinese junks.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">




<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" id="III">III</h2>
</div>

<p>Along the moonlit trail there came wavering
whiffs of orchids, ranging from attar of roses and
carnations to the pungence of carrion, the latter
doubtless distilled from as delicate and as beautiful
blossoms as the former. There were, besides,
the myriad and bewildering smells of sap, crushed
leaves, and decaying wood; acrid, sweet, spicy,
and suffocating, some like musty books, others
recalling the paint on the Noah’s Ark of one’s
nursery.</p>

<p>But the scent of the giant armadillo eluded us.
When we waded through some new, strange odor
I looked back at Nupee, hoping for some sign
that it was the one we sought. But that night
the great armored creatures went their way and
we ours, and the two did not cross. Nupee
showed me a track at the trail-side made long ago,
as wide and deep as the spoor of a dinosaur, and I
fingered it reverently as I would have touched
the imprint of a recently alighted pterodactyl,
taking care not to spoil the outlines of the huge
claw-marks. All my search for him had been in
vain thus far, though I had been so close upon his
trail as to have seen fresh blood. I had made up
my mind not to give up, but it seemed as if success
must wait for another year.</p>

<p>We watched and called the ghostly kinkajous
and held them fascinated with our stream of light;
we aroused unnamable creatures which squawked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
companionably at us and rustled the tree-top
leaves; we listened to the whispered rush of passing
vampires skimming our faces and were soothed
by the hypnotic droning hum which beetles
left in their swift wake. Finally we turned and
circled through side trails so narrow and so dark
that we walked with outstretched arms, feeling
for the trunks and lianas, choosing a sloth’s gait
and the hope of new adventures rather than the
glare of my flash on our path.</p>

<p>When we entered Kalacoon trail, we headed
toward home. Within sight of the first turn a
great black branch of a tree had recently fallen
across the trail in a patch of moonlight. Before
we reached it, the branch had done something it
should not have done—it had straightened
slightly. We strained our eyes to the utmost but
could not, in this eerie light, tell head from tail
end of this great serpent. It moved very slowly,
and with a motion which perfectly confounded
our perception. Its progress seemed no faster
than the hour hand of a watch, but we knew that
it moved, yet so close to the white sand that the
whole trail seemed to move with it. The eye refused
to admit any motion except in sudden shifts,
like widely separated films of a motion-picture.
For minute after minute it seemed quiescent;
then we would blink and realize that it was <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note—Original text: too feet higher" id="tn-19">two
feet higher</ins> up the bank. One thing we could see—a
great thickening near the centre of the snake:
it had fed recently and to repletion, and slowly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
it was making its way to some hidden lair, perhaps
to lie motionless until another moon should
silver the jungle. Was there any stranger life in
the world?</p>

<p>Whether it was a giant bushmaster or a constrictor,
we could not tell in the diffused light.
I allowed it to go unharmed, for the spell of silence
and the jungle night was too strongly woven
to be shattered again by the crash of gun or rifle.
Nupee had been quite willing to remain behind,
and now, as so often with my savage friends, he
looked at me wonderingly. He did not understand
and I could not explain. We were at one in
the enjoyment of direct phenomena; we could
have passed months of intimate companionship
in the wilds as I had done with his predecessors;
but at the touch of abstract things, of letting a
deadly creature live for any reason except for
lack of a gun—then they looked at me always
with that puzzled look, that straining to grasp
the something which they knew must be there.
And at once always followed instant acceptance,
unquestioning, without protest. The transition
was smooth, direct, complete: the sahib had had
opportunity to shoot; he had not done so; what
did the sahib wish to do now—to squat longer
or to go on?</p>

<p>We waited for many minutes at the edge of a
small glade, and the event which seemed most
significant to me was in actual spectacle one of the
last of the night’s happenings. I sat with chin on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
knees, coolie-fashion—a position which, when
once mastered, and with muscles trained to withstand
the unusual flexion for hour after hour, is
one of the most valuable assets of the wilderness
lover and the watcher of wild things. It enables
one to spend long periods of time in the lowest of
umbrella tents, or to rest on wet ground or sharp
stones where actual sitting down would be impossible.
Thus is one insulated from <i>bêtes rouges</i> and
enthusiastic ants whose sole motto is eternal preparedness.
Thus too one slips, as it were, under
the visual guard of human-shy creatures, whose
eyes are on the lookout for their enemy at human
height. From such a position, a single upward
leap prepares one instantly for advance or retreat,
either of which manœuvres is well within instant
necessity at times. Then there were always the
two positions to which one could change if occasion
required—flat-footed, with arm-pits on
knees, or on the balls of the feet with elbows on
knees. Thus is every muscle shifted and relaxed.</p>

<p>Squatting is one of the many things which a
white man may learn from watching his <i>shikarees</i>
and guides, and which, in the wilderness, he may
adopt without losing caste. We are a chair-ridden
people, and dare hardly even cross our knees
in public. Yet how many of us delight in sitting
Buddha-fashion, or as near to it as we can attain,
when the ban of society is lifted! A chairless
people, however, does not necessarily mean a
more simple, primitive type. The Japanese method<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
of sitting is infinitely more difficult and complex
than ours. The characters of our weak-thighed,
neolithic forbears are as yet too pronounced
in our own bodies for us to keep an upright
position for long. Witness the admirable
admittance of this anthropological fact by the
architects of our subway cars, who know that
only a tithe of their patrons will be fortunate
enough to find room on the cane-barked seats
which have come to take the place of the stumps
and fallen logs of a hundred thousand years ago.
So they have thoughtfully strung the upper
reaches of the cars with imitation branches and
swaying lianas, to which the last-comers cling
jealously, and swing with more or less of the
grace of their distant forbears. Their fur, to be
sure, is rubbed thinner; nuts and fruits have given
place to newspapers and novels, and the roar
and odors are not those of the wind among the
leaves and blossoms. But the simile is amusing
enough to end abruptly, and permit individual
imagination to complete it.</p>

<p>When I see an overtired waiter or clerk swaying
from foot to foot like a rocking elephant, I sometimes
place the blame further back than immediate
impatience for the striking of the closing hour.
It were more true to blame the gentlemen whose
habits were formed before caste, whose activities
preceded speech.</p>

<p>We may be certain that chairs will never go out
of fashion. We are at the end of bodily evolution<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
in that direction. But to see a white-draped,
lanky Hindu, or a red-cloaked lama of the hills,
quietly fold up, no matter where he may be, is to
witness the perfection of chairless rest. One can
read or write or doze comfortably, swaying
slightly with a bird’s unconscious balance, or, as
in my case at present, wholly disarm suspicion
on the part of the wild creatures by sinking from
the height of a man to that of a jungle deer. And
still I had lost nothing of the insulation which my
moccasins provided from all the inconveniences
of the forest floor. Looking at Nupee after this
rush of chaotic thoughts which came between
jungle happenings, I chuckled as I hugged my
knees, for I knew that Nupee had noticed and silently
considered my little accomplishment, and
that he approved, and I knew that I had acquired
merit in his sight. Thus may we revel in the approval
of our super-servants, but they must never
know it.</p>

<p>From this eulogy of squatting, my mind returned
to the white light of the glade. I watched
the motionless leaves about me, many of them
drooping and rich maroon by daylight, for they
were just unbudded. Reaching far into the dark
mystery of the upper jungle stretched the air-roots,
held so straight by gravity, so unheeding of
the whirling of the planet through space. Only
one mighty liana—a monkey-ladder—had revolted
against this dominance of the earth’s pull
and writhed and looped upon itself in fantastic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
whorls, while along its length rippled ever the undulations
which mark this uneasy growth, this
crystallized Saint Vitus plant.</p>

<p>A momentary shiver of leaves drew our eyes to
the left, and we began to destroy the optical images
evolved by the moon-shadows and to seek the
small reality which we knew lived and breathed
somewhere on that long branch. Then a sharp
crack like a rifle lost whatever it was to us forever,
and we half leaped to our feet as something swept
downward through the air and crashed length
after length among the plants and fallen logs.
The branches overhead rocked to and fro, and for
many minutes, like the aftermath of a volcanic
eruption, came a shower, first of twigs and swirling
leaves, then of finer particles, and lastly of
motes which gleamed like silver dust as they sifted
down to the trail. When the air cleared I saw
that the monkey-ladder had vanished and I knew
that its yards upon yards of length lay coiled and
crushed among the ferns and sprouting palms of
the jungle floor. It seemed most fitting that the
vegetable kingdom, whose silence and majesty
gave to the jungle night its magic qualities, should
have contributed this memorable climax.</p>

<p>Long before the first Spaniard sailed up the
neighboring river, the monkey-ladder had thrown
its spirals aloft, and through all the centuries, all
the years, it had seen no change wrought beneath
it. The animal trail was trod now and then by
Indian hunters, and lately we had passed several<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
times. The sound of our guns was less than the
crashing fall of an occasional forest tree. Now,
with not a leaf moved by the air, with only the
two of us squatting in the moonlight for audience,
the last cell had given way. The sap could no
longer fight the decay which had entered its
heart; and at the appointed moment, the moment
set by the culmination of a greater nexus of
forces than our human mind could ever hope to
grasp, the last fibre parted and the massive growth
fell.</p>

<p>In the last few minutes, as it hung suspended,
gracefully spiraled in the moonlight, it had seemed
as perfect as the new-sprouted <i>moras</i> at my feet.
As I slowly walked out of the jungle I saw in this
the explanation of the simile of artificial scenery,
of all the strange magic which had come to me as
I entered. The alchemy of moonlight turned all
the jungle to perfect growth, growth at rest. In
the silvery light was no trace of gnawing worm,
of ravening ant, or corroding fungus. The jungle
was rejuvenated and made a place more wonderful
than any fairyland of which I have read or
which I have conceived. The jungle by day, as I
have said—that, too, is wonderful. We may
have two friends, quite unlike in character, whom
we love each for his own personality, and yet it
would be a hideous, an unthinkable thing to see
one transformed into the other.</p>

<p>So, with the mist settling down and tarnishing
the great plaque of silver, I left the jungle, glad<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
that I could be far away before the first hint of
dawn came to mar the magic. Thus in memory
I can keep the dawn away until I return.</p>

<p>And sometime in the future, when the lure of
the full moon comes, and I answer, I shall be certain
of finding the same silence, the same wonderful
light, and the waiting trees and the magic.
But Nupee may not be there. He will perhaps
have slipped into memory, with Drojak and Aladdin.
And if I find no one as silently friendly as
Nupee, I shall have to watch alone through my
jungle night.</p>

royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,

unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div>

<div style='display:block; font-size:1.1em; margin:1em 0; font-weight:bold'>
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
